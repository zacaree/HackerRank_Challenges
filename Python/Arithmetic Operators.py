# Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Sample input
a = 3
b = 2

# Sample output
# 5
# 1
# 6
