// decimal | binary

let n = 10; // 1010
let i = 6; // 110

// If you pass a number to the toString method that tells the method what base you're asking for.
// Do you want binary, do you want base 10, do you want base 16, etc?
// With that in mind, the logs below will return the binary values for 10 and 6. Cool!
console.log(n.toString(2));
console.log(i.toString(2));
